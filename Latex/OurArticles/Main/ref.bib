	abstract = {Attention-based long short-term memory ({LSTM}) networks have proven to be useful in aspect-level sentiment classification. However, due to the difficulties in annotating aspect-level data, existing public datasets for this task are all relatively small, which largely limits the effectiveness of those neural models. In this paper, we explore two approaches that transfer knowledge from document- level data, which is much less expensive to obtain, to improve the performance of aspect-level sentiment classification. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches on 4 public datasets from {SemEval} 2014, 2015, and 2016, and we show that attention-based {LSTM} benefits from document-level knowledge in multiple ways.},
